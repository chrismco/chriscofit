                <h4>Piggybacking is genius</h4>
                <p>Purchasing a tradeline from True Profile Credit we add you as an authorized user to our revolving credit lines which have years of perfect payment history and low utilization ratios maximizing their credit benefit. Each month the creditor reports this history not only for the primary owner, but also for the authorized users of the
                    account. This is called “credit piggybacking”. About 30% of all credit reports contain at least one authorized user account, so they’re a common part of credit.</p>
