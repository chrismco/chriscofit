                <h4>Why you need credit repair</h4>
                <p>When you apply for credit; whether for a credit card, a car loan, or a mortgage - lenders want to know what risk they'd take by loaning money to you. Most lenders use credit scores to determine your credit risk. You have credit scores from three credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax; the credit scores are based on your credit reports the credit bureaus keep on file about you. As this information changes, your credit scores tend to change as well. Your 3 credit scores affect both how much and what loan terms (interest rate, etc.) lenders will offer you at any given time. Taking steps to improve your credit scores can help you qualify for better rates from lenders.</p>
